    <h2>Steps to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil and butter in a heat resistance pot, then add the chicken breast, paprika, cayenne, onion, celery, green pepper, garlic and ginger. Saute for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped carrots next and saute for a minute with little salt.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, tomatoes along with curry powder, bay leaf & thyme. Cook until tomatoes get slightly soft. For about 3 minutes until you see the oil getting red. Then add frozen veggies. . Add the rice next. Saute for another 2 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups of vegetable stock/water, bouillon cube, required salt,close the lid and cook until 90% cooked, for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow the rice to continue cooking until the rice is soft. If it is not dry at this point, then switch the heat to low to allow it to dry the excess water without making the rice much softer.</li>
        <li>If rice is still lil hard, add 1/4 cup water and cover with foil, which will allow it to steam through. Check back at 5 min and It should be ready. You want your rice not too soft.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro/parsely and serve.</li>
